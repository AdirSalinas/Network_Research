# Network Research Project
### Short Purpose Of The Project
This script automates secure installations, verifies network anonymity, and conducts scans on various domains and IP addresses. It ensures privacy by remotely connecting to external servers and sending commands to perform the scans for you.

## What the project does and what the purpose of it ? 
What the project does and what the purpose of it ?
In the internet world, like everything in the world there is a good side but there are also
things that are not always good and allowed to be done and might be illegal to do.
In such cases the experienced people who do these kind of things, will always try to hide
themselves and be anonymous as possible so they can't be tracked down.

- [ ] An example of one of the things that is illegal to do is **“unauthorized scanning”** .

### So what does that mean?
Unauthorized scanning involves probing or examining computer networks or domains
without proper permission or authorization, often for assessing vulnerabilities or identifying
open ports without the explicit consent of the network owner.

There are several ways to perform these kinds of scans, and additional details and more information about them will be found in the PDF doc.

### So what will the script perform?
* The script will focus on unauthorized scanning of a chosen Domains or IP addresses.
Before any scan being executed, the script was built to make sure that your internet
connection is completely unassociated with your location and you are totally anonymous
before moving on to perform the scans.

* The second part of the script will connect remotely to another server that will perform these
scans for you in order to hide yourself more and make it even more difficult to tracked you,
if they will try to catch whoever did these scan, the server you connected to will be tracked.

* The last part of the script will save all the data, details and information that the server scan in
files and will transfer them into your computer safely without you being exposed.
